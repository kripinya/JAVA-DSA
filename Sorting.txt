sorting refers to rearrangement of a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.
- it is imp as it reduces the complexity of the problem

sorting basics
1. in place sorting-(uses constant space for producing the output, modifies the given array only)
2. Internal sorting - when all the data is placed in the main memory or internal memory, probkem cannot take inout beyond allocated memory size.
3. External sorting - when all the data is placed in memory at a time, used for masive amount of data 
4. Stable sorting- when two same items appear in same order in sorted data as in the original array 
5. Hybrid sorting- a sorting algo which uses more than one standard sorting algo to sort the array.

Types of sorting techni-
1. comparison based- we compare the elements in a comparisonbassed sorting algo(bubbl, insertion, selection, quick, merge, heap)
2. non-comparison based- we do not compare te elements in a non comparison based sorting algo(counting, radix)

//selection sort
1. First we find the smallest element and swap it with the first element. This way we get the smallest element at its correct position.
2. Then we find the smallest among remaining elements (or second smallest) and swap it with the second element.
3. We keep doing this until we get all elements moved to correct position.
